# Project 2 - Data Modeling with Cassandra

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create an ETL pipeline to enable the Sparkify analytics team to utilise song and user activty logs captured from our new music streaming app so as to better understand our users and support future app updates/business decisions. The current focus of the analytics team is to gain a better understanding of what songs users are listening to. This project will create an Apache Cassandra database with existing data stored in CSV files and create requested queries.
